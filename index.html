  	<h3>whoami?</h3>
  	<p>
  	  My name is Joshua Davenport. I am a student at Illinois Institute of Technology and my major is Applied Cybersecurity and
  	  information technology. If you want to learn more about my education and experience, take a look at 
  	  <a href="resume.html">my resume</a>. Otherwise, I have many hobbies that include (but are not limited by) listening to music, 
  	  gaming, watching youtube, and fencing.
  	</p>

  	<h3>Music I listen to</h3>
  	<p>
  	  Generally my answer to "What kind of music do you listen to?" is indie rock, as most of my favorite bands are indie rock
  	  bands. In reality, I listen to all kinds of music and would consider myself generally knowledgable in popular music and artists.
  	  Recently I have had the song "Let Me Go" by YONLAPA on loop. Another song I've been binging a lot (but not quite as much) is "Lagoon"
  	  by Favored Nations. I definitely suggest you check out either of these songs and at least give them a try. And if you're open to
  	  listening to some music, you should check out one of my top three favorite bands:
  	</p>
  	<ol>
  	  <li>The Strokes</li>
  	  <li>Cage The Elephant</li>
  	  <li>Paramore</li>
  	</ol>

  	<h3>Games I play</h3>
  	<p>
  	  I'm not going to go too much into depth on the games I play because I have a whole page dedicated to that <a href="games.html">here</a>.
  	  Still, I will talk a little bit about some genres I enjoy in video games. My favorite genre of game is definitely the Japanese Role 
  	  Playing Game, also known as JRPGs. JRPGs tend to be longer story driven games. Some popular JRPGs that you may have heard of are 
  	  the Final Fantasy series, Chrono series, and even the Pokemon series.
