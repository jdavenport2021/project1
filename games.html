      <h3>Favorite Genre of Games</h3>
      <p>
        As I touched up at my home page, my favorite genre of games is the JRPG by a long shot. JRPGs tend to be longer, have a lot of content, 
        and have a strong focus on the story. These games have given me more bang for buck than any other genre of game I have ever played.
        For example, I bought a JRPG on sale for $30 at one point, and then went on to spend nearly 250 hours in that exact game before
        getting bored. That is only 12 cents per hour of play. Even if I had payed full price $60, it would only by 24 cents per hour.
        Many big games in the west sell for $60, now sometimes $70 and have a playtime of 20 hours. While I enjoy plenty of these kinds
        of games as well, when it comes to JRPGs, their bang for buck may come second only to multiplayer games, especially with many
        moving towards the free to play model. While some of these playtimes may seem daunting, these times are only if you're trying to
        experience the entirety of the game, but if you just want to experience the story, they can also be shorter experiences.

      <h3>My Favorite Games</h3>
      <p>
        After all that gushing about a genre of all things, I would like you to guess the genre of my top 4 favorite games. If you guessed
        anything other than JRPG I don't think you've been paying enough attention. My top 5 games are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Persona 4 Golden</li>
        <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</li>
        <li>Persona 5 Royal</li>
        <li>Overwatch</li>
        <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Persona Series</h3>
      <p>
        As you can see above, the Persona series holds a dominant position in my top 5 favorite games, with Persona 4 Golden (p4g) and Persona
        5 Royal (p5r) holding the 1st and 3rd places respectively. I have no doubt that Persona 3 will inevitably push out Xenoblade Chronicles 3
        but I am currently working through that one and since I haven't finished it I don't want to put it on my list yet since the ending could
        always be awful. Now, what exactly is the persona series? The Persona series is half social simulator, half dungeon 
        crawling/exploration of a different parallel world. You have to manage your time in the real world so you can spend time with other 
        characters and build your character's stats. Well why would you ever want to spend time with other characters? Well each of the
        characters that you can spend time with each have their own problems and stories that are built upon by spending time with them.
        While these characters' stories can be great, spending time with them actually also strengthens you in the other parallel world,
        making it easier to progress and granting new skills. This is the basics of the series but ultimately what will draw the player in
        is usually the story, characters, and if you're like me, the fantastic music by Shoji Meguro.

      <h4>Persona 4 Golden</h4>
      <img src="media/p4g.gif" alt="Gif showing a TV with Persona 4 logo">
      <p>
        In p4g, you play as a highschool student who just moved from the big city into the small rural town of Yaso Inaba in Japan. While
        there, you live with your uncle Ryotaro Dojima and his daughter Nanako Dojima. While you're living with them, you hear a rumor
        at school about a thing called the "Midnight Channel", where it is said if you look into your TV at exactly midnight on a 
        rainy day, you're supposed to see your soulmate. You decide to give this rumor a go, and to your surprise, at exactly midnight,
        on a rainy day, you actually see the figure of a woman. In your disbelief you touch the screen, and end up going through the TV.
        This leads to the revelation that there is a whole other world inside the TV, one where you can use these Personas to battle 
        monsters. Shortly after this revelation, strange murders start happening around Inaba, and they seem to always be inexplicably
        linked to this other world and the Midnight Channel. You and your friends decide to investigate this phenomenon taking you
        on a unforgettable trip with all its ups and downs as you try to get to the bottom of the murders. This game explores themes of 
        finding the truth, no matter how hard it is to bear, and acceptance of yourself.

    <section id="p5r">
      <h4>Persona 5 Royal</h4>
      <img src="media/p5r.gif" alt="Gif showing end of all out attack">
      <p>
        In p5r, you once again, play as a highschool student, but this time you moved from a small rural town, into the big city,
        Tokyo. However, your move to Tokyo came due to you having a criminal record you got after trying to intervene while a man
        was forcing himself on a woman. While on a train to Tokyo, you notice an app on your phone that you don't recall downloading
        and delete it. As is common to the Persona series, you start school not long after your arrival to the new location, and on
        your very first day of classes, the app reappears and turns out to be a "GPS" to another world. Because of this, you end up 
        at a castle where the school should be, and a teacher from the school seemingly runs this castle and is abusing students within
        it. Upon escaping the castle, back into the real world you get to school late, where your tardiness is seen as evidence of 
        you being a delinquent to both students and teachers alike. From here, you investigate the castle and find out it is 
        a representation of what a real person thinks of a location and the people in it, meaning this teacher really was abusing 
        students. You and a group of friends investigate this castle and others like it. This game explores themes of injustice,
        the harm and good society can bring, and staying true to yourself. This game has an especially notable soundtrack, and 
        if you have spent enough time on YouTube watching video essays, commentary, or similar content, it is almost 
        guaranteed you've heard at least one of the songs from the Persona 5 soundtrack. I have included audio from one of my 
        favorite songs in the game below.
