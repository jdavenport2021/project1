    <h3>Favorite Genre of Games</h3>
    <p>
      As I touched up at my home page, my favorite genre of games is the JRPG by a long shot. JRPGs tend to be longer, have a lot of content, 
      and have a strong focus on the story. These games have given me more bang for buck than any other genre of game I have ever played.
      For example, I bought a JRPG on sale for $30 at one point, and then went on to spend nearly 250 hours in that exact game before
      getting bored. That is only 12 cents per hour of play. Even if I had payed full price $60, it would only by 24 cents per hour.
      Many big games in the west sell for $60, now sometimes $70 and have a playtime of 20 hours. While I enjoy plenty of these kinds
      of games as well, when it comes to JRPGs, their bang for buck may come second only to multiplayer games, especially with many
      moving towards the free to play model. While some of these playtimes may seem daunting, these times are only if you're trying to
      experience the entirety of the game, but if you just want to experience the story, they can also be shorter experiences.
