    <h3>Favorite Genre of Games</h3>
    <p>
      As I touched up at my home page, my favorite genre of games is the JRPG by a long shot. JRPGs tend to be longer, have a lot of content, 
      and have a strong focus on the story. These games have given me more bang for buck than any other genre of game I have ever played.
      For example, I bought a JRPG on sale for $30 at one point, and then went on to spend nearly 250 hours in that exact game before
      getting bored. That is only 12 cents per hour of play. Even if I had payed full price $60, it would only by 24 cents per hour.
      Many big games in the west sell for $60, now sometimes $70 and have a playtime of 20 hours. While I enjoy plenty of these kinds
      of games as well, when it comes to JRPGs, their bang for buck may come second only to multiplayer games, especially with many
      moving towards the free to play model. While some of these playtimes may seem daunting, these times are only if you're trying to
      experience the entirety of the game, but if you just want to experience the story, they can also be shorter experiences.

    <h3>My Favorite Games</h3>
    <p>
      After all that gushing about a genre of all things, I would like you to guess the genre of my top 4 favorite games. If you guessed
      anything other than JRPG I don't think you've been paying enough attention. My top 5 games are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Persona 4 Golden</li>
      <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</li>
      <li>Persona 5 Royal</li>
      <li>Overwatch</li>
      <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Persona Series</h3>
    <p>
      As you can see above, the Persona series holds a dominant position in my top 5 favorite games, with Persona 4 Golden (p4g) and Persona
      5 Royal (p5r) holding the 1st and 3rd places respectively. I have no doubt that Persona 3 will inevitably push out Xenoblade Chronicles 3
      but I am currently working through that one and since I haven't finished it I don't want to put it on my list yet since the ending could
      always be awful. Now, what exactly is the persona series? The Persona series is half social simulator, half dungeon 
      crawling/exploration of a different parallel world. You have to manage your time in the real world so you can spend time with other 
      characters and build your character's stats. Well why would you ever want to spend time with other characters? Well each of the
      characters that you can spend time with each have their own problems and stories that are built upon by spending time with them.
      While these characters' stories can be great, spending time with them actually also strengthens you in the other parallel world,
      making it easier to progress and granting new skills. This is the basics of the series but ultimately what will draw the player in
      is usually the story and characters.
